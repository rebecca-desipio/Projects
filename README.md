## Graduate Research @ VT: Hand Tremor Detection
Description: Using a hand-drawn spiral public dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kmader/parkinsons-drawings), studying machine learning methods for classifying healthy vs Parkinson's disease patients. Implementation consists of using computer vision algorithms along with CNNs to perform the classification. Also studying SVMs and regression algorithms for further analysis and consideration of an ensemble model. 

** This is still a work in progress **

Main files:
 - spiralClassifier_rev4.ipynb (this is the most up-to-date version containing currently explored methods)
 - objectDetection.ipynb (used to find the center locations of the spirals)
 - code_files/archSpiral, imagePreprocessing, and plottingFunctions hold functions that are called in rev4 notebook - solely used to keep the code a bit cleaner

## Music Through the Decades
Data visualization storyboard exploring the trends in music data across the decades.
Link to published GitPages storyboard, submitted for course project. Voted top project by the professor. https://adwaitvt.github.io/Guided-Project2/

Main Contributions:
- js/decadeTopArtists.js
- js/mainMessage.js
- Designed and implemented the structure and aesthetic features of the storyboard using HTML and CSS

## Course assignments using JavaScript (and D3), HTML, and CSS

Coded from scratch:
 - HW3: Interactive visualization with linked views (area chart and bar charts) to present data on microfinance loans.
 - Lab 6: Implemented D3 update pattern on barchart showing coffee house chains dataset.
 - Lab 9: Created a network visualization via as an adjacency matrix on Florence Familiar dataset.

Coded from template:
 - Lab 10: Integrated event handling to connect mutliple visualization components and UI elements. Completed the barchart visualization.
 - HW4: Interactive Covid Dashboard - implemented chloropleth map and bar charts.

## Computer Vision Tasks
 - Contours: implemented three algorithms: Pavlidis contour extractor, Gaussian area estimation, nad discrete curve evolution 
 - Harris Corner Detection: implemented harris corner detection and compared against OpenCV corner detection method
 - Image Stitching: implemented image stitching algorithm by finding proper geometric transformations and combined three images into a single resulting image
 - QR code reader: program that performs the first steps of QR code recognition - find the QR code in an image and produce a recitified image



## Morse Code Translator
Description: using the Nintendo Wiimote, created a morsecode translator using the A (dots) and B (dashes) buttons as input.
